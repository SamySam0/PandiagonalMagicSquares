Solving a Constraint Satisfaction Problem: Pan-diagonal Magic Squares<br />

A pandiagonal magic square is a type of magic square where not only do the rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same sum, but also the broken diagonals (i.e. the diagonals that are not parallel to the sides of the square) also add up to that same sum. The pandiagonal magic square problem is a constraint satisfaction problem where the goal is to fill in the cells of a square with integers such that all of the rows, columns, diagonals, and broken diagonals add up to the same sum. This problem can be solved using techniques such as backtracking and constraint propagation, which involve iteratively narrowing down the possible solutions based on the constraints that must be satisfied.
